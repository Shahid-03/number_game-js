## Overview

The Number Game Project is a web application that allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It also keeps track of the user's score and highscore.

## Game Rules

- The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.
- The player enters a guess and clicks the "Check" button.
- If the guess is correct, the player wins, and the game displays a congratulatory message.
- If the guess is incorrect, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The player starts with a score of 20, and each incorrect guess reduces the score.
- The highscore is updated if the current score surpasses the previous highscore.
- The player can start a new game by clicking the "Again" button.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the game.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the game interface.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic using JavaScript.
